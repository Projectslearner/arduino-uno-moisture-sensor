# Arduino Uno Soil Moisture Sensor

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a soil moisture sensor with an Arduino Uno to monitor soil moisture levels. The sensor's readings are mapped to a percentage value representing the moisture content, which is then displayed on the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **Soil Moisture Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Soil Moisture Sensor to Arduino Uno:**
   - VCC pin of the sensor: Connect to 5V on Arduino.
   - GND pin of the sensor: Connect to GND on Arduino.
   - Analog output pin of the sensor: Connect to analog pin A0 on Arduino.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire up the soil moisture sensor to the Arduino Uno as per the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set the baud rate to 9600).
   - Observe the sensor value and moisture percentage readings.

#### Applications

- **Agriculture:** Monitor soil moisture levels to optimize irrigation.
- **Gardening:** Keep track of soil moisture to maintain healthy plants.
- **Automated Systems:** Integrate with other systems for automated watering based on soil moisture.

#### Notes

- Ensure proper calibration of the sensor to get accurate moisture readings.
- Adjust the mapping function in the code if the sensor's range differs.
- Regularly clean the sensor to prevent corrosion and ensure longevity.
